# Priorizer App

Application for priorizing daily tasks by using [Eisenhower Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method) made with [React](https://reactjs.org/)
 ### ✨ [Demo](https://attuo.github.io/priorizer)
  
## 🤓 Motivation

This is my little toy program for tinkering with React and trying out all kind of different concepts and libraries in the ever changing frontend world! I wanted to make something different than a typical Todo-list, so I created a just a little bit different Todo-list, the Eisenhower Matrix. You can read more about it from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method) or [here](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/eisenhower-matrix). 

## 🛠️ Technical details

Here is the list of concepts and libraries that I have used and what I'm about to test here someday.

Used libraries and concepts
- [X] React
- [X] Template ([create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app))
- [X] Drag and Drop ([react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd))
- [X] Icons ([feather](https://github.com/feathericons/react-feather))
- [X] Animations ([transition-group](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/))
- [X] Local Storage saving

Still work in progress
- [ ] Transition to TypeScript
- [ ] Transition to css-in-js (Styled Components)
- [ ] Tests with Jest
- [ ] Overall UI overhaul
- [ ] Every px values to em/rem
- [ ] Better responsiveness (mobile first)

Might add someday
- [ ] More permanent storage than browser's local storage (for example with [FileSystem API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileSystem) or some Cloud storage integration)
- [ ] Smoother and better animations
- [ ] Better accessibility (for example keyboard support)
- [ ] Optimizations here and there
- [ ] Overall code structure improvements
- [ ] PWA functionalities

## 🚀 Usage

*  Option 1. Use it straight from the [website](https://attuo.github.io/priorizer) (tasks are saved only to your browser's local storage)
*  Option 2. Use and run it locally
   *  > git clone https://github.com/attuo/priorizer.git
   *  > yarn install / npm install
   *  > yarn start / npm start
